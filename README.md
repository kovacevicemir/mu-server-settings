# Mu Online Server Config Files

This repository contains configuration files for Mu Online servers. These files can be used to modify various server settings, including experience rate, drop rate, mob spawns, and more.

The main purpose of this repository is to keep track of what has been added or modified within the server configuration, allowing for easier rollbacks and facilitating the development process.

These configuration files can also be pulled or copied over to production environments when needed, ensuring that changes are consistently applied across environments.
